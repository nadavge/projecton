 * The frequency is calculated by dividing the number of samples by the time it took
 * to sample them. Since the time is in micros, the frequency is in MHz. Therefore,
 * to get it to Hz we need to multiply by 10^6. Totally, we send here up to the 10 Hz
 * rounding, since we only get the 5 first digits above the dot.
